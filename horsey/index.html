			<p>Horsey does not store or transmit any of your personal information. When you choose to copy a file to Dropbox using Horsey, the URL and file name you chose are sent to Dropbox (so Dropbox can copy the file). Horsey does not store or transmit your Dropbox username and password. Horsey opens a window which lets you enter your authentication information directly into the Dropbox website. The location you choose to save the file is also handled through the Dropbox site. Any information you share with Dropbox is subject to the privacy policy of Dropbox. By using this extension to copy files to your Dropbox account, you agree to give Horsey permission to send Dropbox the URL you wish to copy to your Dropbox account, and the file name you wish to save the file as. Without sending Dropbox the URL and file name, Dropbox will not have the required information to copy the file you requested.</p>
			
			<h3 id="Notice">Terms of use</h3>
			<hr class="remove-bottom"/>
			<p>By using this extension, you agree to the following terms, which may be amended from time to time without prior notice to you. As this extension is intended to be used with Dropbox, you would be subject to the terms of service of Dropbox as well (which you would have agreed to when creating your Dropbox account). Dropbox requires that users have the right to store the content they upload to their Dropbox. If you intend to use this extension to download content from other services or websites without having the proper legal rights, then you may not download this extension. You may use this extension for lawful purposes only. Before using this extension please read the <a href="faq.html">Faq</a> and <a href="troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting</a> sections of this site to have a better idea of what this extension can and cannot do. As this extension uses a third party service (Dropbox), this extension is dependent on Dropbox, and subject to any outages or interruptions to the Dropbox service. You shouldn't use this extension for any mission critical purposes, and agree to not hold me liable for any damages as a result of the performance of this extension or the Dropbox service</p>
			
			<h3>Support</h3>
			<hr class="remove-bottom"/>
			<p>This extension has been build independently by me, Rahul Iyer. It has no affiliation with Dropbox or Apple. This extension uses the Dropbox API, as well as the Safari API. If you need help using Horsey, please refer to the <a href="faq.html">Faq</a> and the <a href="troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting</a> sections of this site first. If you still have questions, feel free to contact me using the email address described below. If you have specific questions regarding Dropbox, or Apple products, please refer to their respective websites.</p>
	
			<h3 id="Contact%20me">Contact me</h3>
			<hr class="remove-bottom"/>
			<p>Is Horsey being stubborn? Not carrying his load? Behaving like an ass? For that, and any other reason, you may contact me by sending email to: <strong>[the name of this extension]@[rahuliyer].com</strong>. Be sure to replace the information within [ ] with the correct information. </p>
