			<hr class="remove-bottom"/>
			<h4>How much does it cost to use this site?</h4>
			<p>You may and use this site for free. It is ad supported</p>
			<h4>How does it work?</h4>
			<p>First you type in the url (eg: http://example.org/file.html) and filename (eg: file.html) of the file you wish to download into the text boxes marked "URL" and "Save as filename". When you click on "Choose location", Donkix tells the Dropbox website the URL you wish to download and the file name you wish to save it as. A window opens up which allows you to log into the Dropbox website (If you are not already logged into the Dropbox website). Then you may choose which folder to save the file to. When you click "Save" the Dropbox window closes and the Dropbox starts the copy the file. The window that Donkix opened up to let you edit the URL and filename will now show a progress bar next to the file name to indicate how much progress Dropbox has made when trying to download your file. If there is any problem, an error message will appear in this window.</p>
			<h4>Why should I use Donkix? I can download files directly to my computer!</h4>
			<p>You may certainly download files directly to your computer, but there are situations when saving a file directly to your Dropbox account may be more useful:
				<ul class="disc">
					<li><strong>When downloading large files</strong>, you may want to copy the file directly to you Dropbox account to save space on your computer.</li>
					<li><strong>When the connection between your computer and the website containing the file is slow, but the connection between you and Dropbox is fast</strong>, it may take less time to copy the file from the website directly to Dropbox, and let the Dropbox app download the file to your computer.</li>
					<li><strong>If your internet connection is unreliable</strong>, it may make more sense to let Dropbox download the file directly to your account, and then use the Dropbox app to transfer the file to your computer. The internet connection between Dropbox and the website containing your file is probably faster and more reliable. Once the file is on Dropbox you can sync the file to your computer.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h4>How do I know if the file was successfully copied to Dropbox?</h4>
			<p>If you left the progress window open, you will see the progress bar change as the copy proceeds. When the copy is successful, you will see a small tick / check mark against the file name and in the progress bar. If you closed the progress window before the transfer completed, you can look in your Dropbox folder on the Dropbox website. If you have set the folder to sync with your device, then you can just look in the Dropbox folder on your device.</p>
			<h4>Does Donkix store, transmit or share the websites I visit or files I download with anyone?</h4>
			<p>No - Donkix does not store, transmit or share the websites you visit with anyone. When you try to download a file using Donkix, the only information Donkix sends to Dropbox is the URL to the file you intend to copy, as well as the name of the file. This is required for Dropbox to download the file. The window that opens up to let you log into Dropbox, and select the folder to save to, is operated by Dropbox. Any information you store on Dropbox is subject to the privacy policy of Dropbox</p>
			<h4>Do I have to wait for the copy to complete?</h4>
			<p>Once the progress bar appears, you can be assured that Dropbox is attempting to copy the file you requested. Normally the copy should complete successfully. There are situations when a copy won't be successful - such as when your Dropbox account is full, or if there is a server error. On such occasions, the error message normally appears on the window. If you close the window you won't see the error message, and you won't know that the copy didn't complete until you check your Dropbox account.</p>
			<h4>What if I want to download files directly to my computer?</h4>
			<p>Donkix doesn't remove any functionality. You can download files to your device just like you always did. Donkix tells Dropbox to download a file only when you intentionally choose the option of saving to Dropbox</p>
			<h4>What if I don't want the file to be downloaded to my computer from Dropbox?</h4>
			<p>You can configure the Dropbox app on your device to sync only certain folders. When the Dropbox Saver window opens, select the folder that you have chosen not to sync with your device. The file will be saved to that folder on your Dropbox account, but will not sync with the devices in which you have configured Dropbox not to sync that folder.</p>
			<h4>Why does Donkix show me the URL and file name before opening the Dropbox saver?</h4>
			<p>Some websites use a number of techniques to hide the real url on their webpage. Donkix shows you the url, so you can determine if it is the one you intend to download. Keep in mind, that neither Donkix nor Dropbox know what the actual content of the file being downloaded is. It is up to you to download files only from trustworthy websites. When Donkix reads a url, it attempts to suggest a file name based on the last part of the url. This name may not be descriptive to you, and so you should choose a file name that will describe to you what the file is.</p>
			<h4>Why do I have to choose a location in my Dropbox account each time?</h4>
			<p>Donkix doesn't know anything about your Dropbox account. All it does is send Dropbox a URL and filename. Dropbox opens the Dropbox saver so you can log in, and choose the location where to save the file.</p>
			<h4>I can't read the full URL or filename. It is too long!</h4>
			<p>You can scroll through the URL or filename input field to read the entire text. Some websites have large urls and filenames. You can change the filename to any valid filename, but you shouldn't change the URL unless you are attempting to download a different file. The URL signifies the location of the file you are trying to download. If you change the URL, Dropbox will look at the new URL which may point to a location that does not exist.</p>
			<h4>Can I use Donkix to copy images to my Dropbox account?</h4>
			<p>Yes you can! Right-click on the image, and select "Copy image to Dropbox" from the context menu that appears. The rest of the process is the same as when you save files to Dropbox.</p>
			<h4>Why did you make this extension?</h4>
			<p>I was trying to download images from the NASA website, but the files would take too long to download. I figured that maybe the connection between my computer and NASA is slow, but between Dropbox and NASA may be fast! So I started looking at the Dropbox API, and tried it out.</p>
