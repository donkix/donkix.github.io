When you choose to copy a file to Dropbox using this site, the URL and file name you chose are sent to Dropbox (so Dropbox can copy the file). This site does not store or transmit your Dropbox username and password. This site opens a window which lets you enter your authentication information directly into the Dropbox website. The location you choose to save the file is also handled through the Dropbox site. Any information you share with Dropbox is subject to the privacy policy of Dropbox. By using this site to copy files to your Dropbox account, you agree to give this site permission to send Dropbox the URL you wish to copy to your Dropbox account, and the file name you wish to save the file as. Without sending Dropbox the URL and file name, Dropbox will not have the required information to copy the file you requested.</p>
